        On the gray fall afternoon of September 24th, Boston College students and faculty gathered on the O'Neill Quad for a
        vigil in memory of Black women and girls killed by police.
        </p>

        <p>The vigil came after the senseless killing of another black woman—this time in Kentucky at the hands of law enforcement.</p>

        <p>Kathryn Destin, a junior at Boston College was one of the speakers at the vigil. She lives with the struggles that come
        with being a student of color on a predominantly white campus.</p>

        <p>“I would lie if I said that being black on campus has been absolutely smooth sailing,” Destin said. “It’s been
        emotionally taxing to be a part of 4.5% of Black students at a predominantly white institution that has made it clear
        that my mental health is not a priority.”</p>

        <p>In 2019, white students on BC’s campus made up 65.9 percent of the undergraduate student body while nationally, 54% of
        all college students were white.</p>

        <p>Last fall, 4.5 percent of BC’s undergraduate students were Black, a number that has only increased by 1.5% since 1980,
        according to BC’s fact books. Federal data shows that the average percentage of Black students on college campuses
        nationwide is 13.9% percent.</p>

        <p>BC is not the only prominent university with such a small percentage of Black students. Black students at top
        educational institutions such as MIT, Northeastern, and Tufts make up less than 5% of the student body, at Boston
        University, it’s four percent. An even more startling statistic: Black student enrollment at all of these top notch
        schools has only increased by less than two percent over the past 40 years.</p>

        <p>“I get a bit angry because how is it that the same problems that I faced when I entered college in 2003 are still around
        and, in some ways, getting worse for students a decade and a half later,” said Anthony Jack, an assistant professor of
        Education at the Harvard Graduate school of Education.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">The "Why" Behind BC's Whiteness</h2>

        <p>When BC opened, in 1863, its mission statement was “to educate Boston's predominantly Irish, Catholic immigrant
        community.” BC doesn’t appear to have strayed very far from that mission as it is still educating a predominantly white
        community today. In fact, in 2019, 65.9% of BC’s student body was white.</p>

        <p>“It’s harder to diversify that space, if that space has not been very diverse historically,” says
        Norm Jones, Director of Diversity at Amherst College.</p>

        <p>And BC Officials say that there are other factors impacting diversity at the college.</p>

        <p>“Most students will only travel about 150-200 miles from home to go to college,” said Gosselin. “And BC is located in a
        less diverse part of the country.”</p>

        <p>However, Amherst College, which is located in rural Massachusetts, only a few hours west of BC, is both a highly diverse
        and highly selective school with 11% black student enrollment. Norm Jones attributes Amherst’s success in diversity to
        its need-blind admissions process. While BC is also a need-blind institution, Amherst also has a robust set of diversity
        outreach programs to thank for its high enrollment of Black students.</p>

        <p>For example, one of their most successful programs is Access to Amherst which pays for low-income students and students
        of color to visit Amherst’s campus before they even apply. The college also visits many low income and majority minority
        high schools.</p>

        <p>Jack McDevitt, director of Northeastern University’s Institute on Race and Justice stated that another reason that
        colleges like BC have only a small percentage of black students is because of the daily challenges students of color
        face on campus.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696266?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">an article</a> from Howard University, minority students at predominantly White college campuses may be
        especially likely to experience racial harassment because of the racialized character of the setting.</p>

        <p>BC has been no exception, in Boston College’s Clery Reports—which indicate crimes on campus, reported that from
        2015-2018, there was at least one. In 2017, there were five. In the same year, there were <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_329.30.asp">78 total incidents</a> of
        vandalism involving racial bias. at all 4-year non-profit colleges.</p>

        <p>In 2018 <a href="https://www.bcheights.com/2018/12/10/michael-sorkin-named-student-arrested-sunday-damage-racist-vandalism/">The Heights</a> reported that Michael Sorkin, CSOM’21 vandalized Welch Hall, with writings of racial slurs across
        furniture, and walls. Sorkin was suspended indefinitely and accepted a <a href="https://www.bcheights.com/2019/10/10/sorkin-plea-deal-civil-rights-violation/">plea deal</a>.</p>

        <p>“It sucks that these weren’t the best four years of my life because of how BC has handled incidents of racism,” said
        Destin, who had hoped to see BC take a stronger stance by expelling Sorkin. “This is supposed to be a fun time in my
        life and I’m supposed to feel safe but I don’t.”</p>

        <p>Destin and other Black students on campus not only have to contend with the explicit racism of hate crimes like the one
        in Welch Hall, but they also feel as though they don’t look like they belong on campus.</p>

        <p>“I’ve woken up to endless social media posts of women who meet the Eurocentric beauty standards of this campus, leading
        me to feel I was the biggest and ugliest eyesore to walk across this lawn,” said Destin.</p>

        <p>McDevitt said that one of the main reasons why many colleges lack diversity in their student body is that many students
        of color come from under-resourced school systems that make it difficult for students to achieve their full potential
        let alone achieve the grades and standardized test scores required for BC admission.</p>


        <p>In fact, the U.S. Department of Education reports that students from urban schools with high levels of poverty don’t
        have the same access to resources and their schools have significantly less funding from state and local government.</p>

        <p>“Some students of color come from urban school systems that aren’t the best … and that doesn’t mean they couldn’t be
        successful and contribute to the community,” McDevitt said.</p>

        <p>For schools like BC, this may mean looking past students standardized test scores. While Gosselin claims that the
        admissions process looks at the whole student, BC’s CollegeBoard profile shows that “Rigor of secondary school record”
        and “Standardized test scores” are listed as “Very Important” in the admissions process. Students’ race and ethnicity as
        well as first generation status are listed only as “Considered” factors.</p>
